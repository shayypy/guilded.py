        The id of the status.
    game_id: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The id of the game that this status is for.

    .. warning::
        You cannot pass custom strings to this class. To avoid hard-coding
        every Guilded-supported game into this library as an enum, you can
        find a list of valid game IDs next to their names
        `on the API docs <https://guildedapi.com/resources/user#game-ids>`_\.

    Parameters
    -----------
    game_id: Optional[:class:`int`]
        The game's ID that this Game should represent.
    name: Optional[:class:`str`]
        The game's name that this Game should represent. Case-specific to the
        table linked above.

    Raises
    -------
    ValueError
        You passed neither ``game_id`` nor ``name``, or you passed an unknown game
        name.

    Attributes
    -----------
    game_id: :class:`int`
        The game's ID.
    name: :class:`str`
        The game's name, displays in the client alongside "Playing".
    MAPPING: :class:`dict`
        The internal mapping of valid game IDs to game names. This list can be
        found externally `right here <https://github.com/GuildedAPI/datatables/blob/main/games.json>`_\.
        It is not fetched on startup, so it is recommended for you to do so
        if you prefer to pass names to this class instead of IDs.
